I created my own theme which is a mix of [multiple themes from the offical docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes) adjusted for my needs.

You can find it [here](themes/iamchrishckns.omp.yaml).

## Installation

```bash
ln -s ~/CODE/github.com/iamchrishckns/dotfiles/oh-my-posh/themes/iamchrishckns.omp.yaml ~/.theme.omp.yaml
```

### Linux

The offical installation docs for linux are [here](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/linux).

With homebrew (already includes the default themes):

```bash
brew install jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh/oh-my-posh
```

Manually (requires to clone the default themes separately)

```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/posh-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
```

```bash
mkdir ~/.poshthemes
wget https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/themes.zip -O ~/.poshthemes/themes.zip
unzip ~/.poshthemes/themes.zip -d ~/.poshthemes

It is recommended to have some kind of a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed, otherwise the prompt will not look good ðŸ˜Ÿ.

Right now I use [Delugia](https://github.com/adam7/delugia-code) which is a patched version of Cascadia Code with [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) included.
I use this instead of the original version of [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) by [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) named "Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font" because I had some display issues with it.

[Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) is a open source monospaced font from Microsoft.

~~My favorite [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) which I use almost everywhere is "Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font" which is based on the open source monospaced font "[Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)" from Microsoft.~~

## Customizations

### Devbox

When using a [devbox]() you can set the environment variable `OMP_DEVBOX_NAME` to a name that will be displayed in the prompt next to the `Devbox` segment.

```json
{
  "env": {
      "OMP_DEVBOX_NAME": "TrackMate"
  }

}
```
