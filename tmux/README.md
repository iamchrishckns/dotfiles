## Installation

I use the tmux plugin manager ([TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)) which needs to be installed.
My tmux config "should" install TPM automatically if it is not found.

Just clone the repo and enjoy, if it's not working just install it manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

After that you need to install all configured plugins with `C+Space I`.
This will clone all plugins which are configured in the config and refresh the tmux conf.
