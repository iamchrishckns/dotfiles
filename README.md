Hi, here are my dotfiles, I "try" to keep them up to date so have a look around.

Right now there is no automatic installation script or something like that, maybe in the future I will create one.

## Available configs

Applications:

- [Firefox](firefox/) - My Firefox defaults and multiple profiles configuration

CLI Tools:
- [TMUX](tmux/) - My terminal multiplexer of choice
- [Neovim](nvim/) - My configs (WIP)
- [Oh My Posh](oh-my-posh/) - My favorite cross-platform shell prompt for Windows, Linux and MacOS
- [ZSH](zsh/) - My configs, aliases and functions (WIP)
