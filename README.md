</p>

Hi, here are my dotfiles, I "try" to keep them up to date so have a look around.

Right now there is no automatic installation script or something like that, maybe in the future I will create one.

## Available configs

### TMUX

[More info](tmux/) on my configuration.

### Oh My Posh

Right now I use [Oh My Posh](https://github.com/jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh) as my main prompt.

> Oh My Posh is a prompt theme engine for any shell written in go.

[More info](oh-my-posh/) on my configuration.
